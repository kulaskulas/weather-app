- since the user is traveller, mobile or small view is the best for this application because traveller
  always look at their phone not to a desktop or bigger devices so i set it in a mobile view.
  I add light background to compliment in the main view which is dark color. I choose dark theme because user/traveller
  will use the application outdoor with light reflections high contrast so it is best 
  that application is in dark theme.

- I used the laravel backend as api wrapper only to hide the api key for openweather since it is only free account and only limited
  request is available so i need to hide the api key, i put it in .env and accessed it in api.routes.
